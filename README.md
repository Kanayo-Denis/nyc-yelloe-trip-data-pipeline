# nyc-yellow-trip-data-pipeline
This is an ETL project where data was extracted from a CSV file, before being transformed (data cleaning and conforming the data to usable standards) and loaded in chunks of 100,000. The data being sent to my Postgres database totaled 1,000,000 rows. The primary reason for loading this data into a database was to make comprehensive reports with the data. There are 3 reports in that Jupiter notebook, all for different use cases. This project was a good test of my ETL skills as a data engineer and also an opportunity for me to showcase my expertise.
If you have any questions as regards this project or my services, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via my email address: kaanyodenis@gmail.com
